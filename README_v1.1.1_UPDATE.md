## 🎨 Visual Differences

### Open Position Chart
```
Title: "AAPL - Price History (Open Position)"
Markers: ● Entry (Teal) ... price line ... ● Current (Teal)
Range: Entry - 90 days → Today
```

### Closed Position Chart
```
Title: "AAPL - Price History"
Markers: ● Entry (Teal) ... price line ... ● Exit (Ochre)
Range: Entry - 90 days → Exit + 90 days
```

## 📋 What Was Changed

### Backend

- Returns `is_open` flag to identify position type
- For open: fetches current price and sets end_date to today

### Frontend
- Added "Chart" button to Open Positions table
- Modified chart rendering to check `is_open` flag
- Renders appropriate markers based on position status
- Shows "(Open Position)" in title when applicable

### Files Modified

- `static/js/main.js` (frontend rendering)
- `app/version.py` (version update)

**Total**: 3 files, ~110 lines changed

## ✅ Testing Checklist

## 🎯 Key Features

| Feature | Open Position | Closed Position |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Chart Button | ✅ | ✅ |
| Entry Marker | ● Teal | ● Teal |
| Second Marker | ● Teal (Current) | ● Ochre (Exit) |
| End Date | Today | Exit + 90 days |
| Title Suffix | "(Open Position)" | None |
| Interactive | ✅ | ✅ |

---

## 📈 Performance

- **Open positions**: 2-5 seconds (fetches current data)
- **Closed positions**: < 1 second (mostly cached)
- **Acceptable**: Per user confirmation

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Chart button not showing on open positions?
- Hard refresh browser: **Ctrl + F5**

### Chart shows wrong marker colors?
- This is by design! Open positions use teal for both entry and current

### Chart not ending at today for open position?
- Try again - should fetch latest data
- Check internet connection
