## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-30 "Visual Insight"

### 🎯 Major Features

#### Added Interactive Price Charts for Closed Positions
- **Chart Modal**: Click "Chart" button on any closed position to view interactive price chart
- **Entry/Exit Markers**: Large colored dots (teal for entry, ochre for exit) mark your trade points
- **Smart Date Ranges**: 
  - Recent positions (< 3 months old): Chart extends from 3 months before entry to today
  - Older positions: Chart shows fixed 6-month window (3 months before/after holding period)
- **Interactive Features**: Zoom, pan, hover tooltips powered by Plotly
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full support for mobile and tablet devices

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Backend

- **Smart Caching Strategy**: 
  - First load: Fetches from Yahoo Finance (2-4 seconds)
  - Subsequent loads: Uses cached data (< 1 second)
  - Minimizes API calls through intelligent reuse
- **Exit Price Calculation**: Automatic calculation from position entry/exit values
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/positions/{id}/chart-data` returns complete chart data

#### Frontend
- **Plotly Integration**: Added Plotly 5.24.1 for interactive charting
- **Chart Modal UI**: New modal with loading spinner and error states
