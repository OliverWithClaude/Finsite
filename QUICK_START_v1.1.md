# Quick Start Guide - Charts Feature (v1.1)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install New Dependency
Open a command prompt in the Finsite directory and run:

```bash
pip install plotly==5.24.1
```

Or install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
This creates the `price_history` table for caching price data:

```bash
python migrate_v1.1.py
```

You should see:
```
Starting migration for v1.1 - Chart feature...
âœ“ price_history table created

Migration completed successfully!
You can now use the chart feature for closed positions.
```

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
start_server.bat
```

Or manually:
```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 4. Test the Feature
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Chart button doesn't appear
**Solution**: Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) to clear cached JavaScript/CSS

### Issue: "Unable to load chart data"
**Possible causes:**
1. No internet connection (yfinance needs internet)
2. Ticker symbol is invalid or delisted
3. Yahoo Finance is temporarily unavailable

**Solution**: Try again later or check if the ticker is valid

### Issue: Chart is slow to load
**Explanation**: First load for a ticker fetches data from Yahoo Finance (2-4 seconds). Subsequent loads use cached data and are much faster (< 1 second).

### Issue: Migration error
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the Finsite directory and the database exists. If issues persist, delete the `data/finsite.db` file and run the app again to recreate the database, then run the migration.

5. **Legend**: Click legend items to show/hide traces
