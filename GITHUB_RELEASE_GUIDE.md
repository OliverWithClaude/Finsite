## Quick Reference Commands

### Common Git Commands for Releases

```bash
# View all tags
git tag -l

# View tag details
git show v1.0.0

# Delete local tag (if mistake)
git tag -d v1.0.0

# Delete remote tag (if mistake)
git push origin --delete v1.0.0

# List all releases
gh release list

# View release details
gh release view v1.0.0

# Edit release

```

## Troubleshooting

### Tag Already Exists

If tag exists locally:
```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Your message"
git push origin v1.0.0 --force
```

### Push Fails

If push is rejected:
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main --rebase

# Then push
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

### Wrong Version Number

If you tagged wrong version:
```bash
# Delete tag locally and remotely
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin --delete v1.0.0

# Create new tag
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Corrected version"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

## Semantic Versioning

- **MAJOR** version (1.x.x): Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version (x.1.x): New functionality, backward compatible
- **PATCH** version (x.x.1): Bug fixes, backward compatible

Examples:
- `v1.0.0` - Initial release
- `v1.1.0` - Add new features (e.g., charts)
- `v1.0.1` - Bug fixes for v1.0.0
- `v2.0.0` - Major rewrite or breaking changes
