# Change Request Implementation - Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Exit Price Per Share Field

**Reason**: Simplified the closing position flow by removing the need to enter exit price per share manually.

**Solution**: The system now automatically calculates the exit price per share based on:
- Number of shares = entry_value_eur / entry_price_per_share
- Exit price per share = exit_value_eur / number of shares

This maintains consistency with the entry data while simplifying user input.

#### Files Modified:

**Backend:**
- `app/database.py` - Removed `exit_price_per_share` column from Position model
- `app/models.py` - Removed `exit_price_per_share` from PositionClose and PositionResponse models
- `app/position_service.py` - Updated `close_position()` to calculate exit price automatically
- `app/main.py` - Updated close endpoint to not expect exit_price_per_share parameter

**Frontend:**
- `templates/index.html` - Removed "Exit Price per Share" field from sell modal
- `static/js/main.js` - Removed sellPrice element and updated form submission

**Changes to Sell Form:**
- Before: Entry Date, Entry Value, Exit Date, Exit Value, **Exit Price per Share**, Currency
- After: Entry Date, Entry Value, Exit Date, Exit Value, Currency

### 2. Added Delete Button for Closed Positions

**Reason**: Allow users to remove closed positions from history when no longer needed.

**Safety**: Only closed positions can be deleted (open positions cannot be deleted to prevent accidental data loss).

#### Files Modified:

**Backend:**
- `app/main.py` - Added `DELETE /api/positions/{position_id}` endpoint
  - Validates position exists
  - Ensures position is CLOSED before allowing deletion
  - Returns error if trying to delete OPEN position

**Frontend:**
- `static/js/main.js` - Added `deleteClosedPosition()` function
  - Shows confirmation dialog before deleting
  - Makes DELETE request to API
  - Refreshes closed positions list after successful deletion
- Updated `renderClosedPositions()` to include Delete button column

**Changes to Closed Positions Table:**
- Added "Action" column with red "Delete" button
- Clicking Delete shows confirmation: "Delete closed position for {TICKER}?"
- On success: Shows message and refreshes the table

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Close Position Without Exit Price
1. Open a position with any ticker
2. Navigate to Open Positions
3. Click "Close" on the position
4. **Notice**: Only 3 input fields now (Exit Date, Exit Value, Currency)
5. Fill in: Exit Date, Exit Value (e.g., 3100), Currency
6. Click "Close Position"
7. **Expected**: Position closes successfully
8. Navigate to Closed Positions
9. **Expected**: Profit/Loss calculated correctly based on entry vs exit value

### Test 2: Delete Closed Position
1. Navigate to Closed Positions view
2. Find any closed position
3. Click the red "Delete" button
4. **Expected**: Confirmation dialog appears
5. Click OK
6. **Expected**: 
   - Success message appears
   - Position is removed from the list
   - Table refreshes

### Test 3: Cannot Delete Open Position (via API)
1. Try to delete an open position via direct API call (e.g., Postman)
2. `DELETE /api/positions/{id}` where id is an open position
3. **Expected**: Error 400 "Can only delete closed positions"

## Database Migration Note

**Important**: The database schema has changed. If you have existing positions with `exit_price_per_share` data:

1. The column still exists in the database but is no longer used
2. New positions will have this field as NULL
3. The application will work correctly with both old and new data

To clean up the database (optional):
```sql
-- SQLite command to drop the unused column (optional, not required)
-- First backup your database!
-- Then create a new table without the column and copy data
```

For most users, no migration is needed - the app handles NULL values gracefully.

## API Changes Summary

### Modified Endpoint
```
POST /api/positions/{position_id}/close
```

**Before:**
```json
{
  "exit_date": "2025-09-30",
  "exit_value_eur": 3100,
  "exit_price_per_share": 155.50,
  "exit_currency": "USD"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "exit_date": "2025-09-30",
  "exit_value_eur": 3100,
  "exit_currency": "USD"
}
```

### New Endpoint
```
DELETE /api/positions/{position_id}
```

**Response Success (200):**
```json
{
  "message": "Position {id} deleted successfully"
}
```

**Response Error (400):**
```json
{
  "detail": "Can only delete closed positions"
}
```

**Response Error (404):**
```json
{
  "detail": "Position {id} not found"
}
```

## Benefits of Changes

### Simplified Exit Flow
- ✅ Fewer fields to fill = faster workflow
- ✅ Less chance of entry errors
- ✅ Automatic calculation ensures consistency
- ✅ Still tracks price per share internally for trades table

### Delete Functionality
- ✅ Clean up historical data
- ✅ Remove test positions
- ✅ Maintain only relevant trading history
- ✅ Safe: Cannot accidentally delete open positions
