## 🔍 What Was Built

### Backend
✅ Price data caching system  
✅ Historical price fetching from Yahoo Finance  
✅ Smart date range calculation  
✅ Exit price calculation from position data  
✅ New API endpoint for chart data  

### Frontend
✅ Interactive Plotly charts  
✅ Beautiful chart modal  
✅ Loading states and error handling  
✅ Mobile responsive design  
✅ Matches your Optimistic Grit theme  

### Performance
✅ First load: 2-4 seconds (fetches data)

✅ No excessive API calls  
✅ Smooth interactions  

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Chart button doesn't show?
- Hard refresh browser: **Ctrl + F5**

### "Unable to load chart data"?
- Check internet connection (Yahoo Finance needs internet)
- Try again in a few seconds
- Check if ticker is valid

### Chart loads slowly?
- First load is always slower (2-4 seconds)
- Second load will be much faster (< 1 second)
- This is normal and expected!

## ✅ Implementation Checklist

Before you start using the feature:

- [ ] Installed Plotly (`pip install plotly==5.24.1`)
- [ ] Ran migration (`python migrate_v1.1.py`)
- [ ] Started server (`start_server.bat`)
- [ ] Hard refreshed browser (Ctrl+F5)
- [ ] Have at least one closed position to test with
- [ ] Clicked "Chart" button and saw the chart!

## 💡 Tips

### Creating Test Data
If you don't have closed positions:
1. Add a ticker (e.g., AAPL)
2. Click "Buy" → Fill in the form → Submit
3. Click "Close" on the open position → Fill in exit data → Submit
4. Now go to "Closed Positions" → Click "Chart"!

### Best Practices
- Let the first chart load complete (2-4 seconds)
- Subsequent loads will be much faster
- Charts cache data permanently - faster each time!
- Zoom in/out by selecting an area with your mouse
- Double-click to reset zoom

### Performance
- **First load**: Downloads from Yahoo Finance
- **Second load**: Uses cached data (10x faster!)
- Charts work offline with cached data
