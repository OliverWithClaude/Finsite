# Testing Guide - Charts Feature (v1.1)

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Ensure You Have Test Data
You need at least one closed position to test the chart feature.

- If you already have closed positions, skip to testing

**Option B: Create Test Data**
1. Add a ticker (e.g., AAPL)
2. Open a position (Buy)
3. Close the position (Sell)
4. Now you have a closed position to test with

## Automated Testing (Optional)

### API Endpoint Test

Test the chart data endpoint directly:

```bash
# Replace {position_id} with actual ID
curl http://localhost:8000/api/positions/{position_id}/chart-data
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "entry_date": "2025-01-15",
  "exit_date": "2025-03-20",
  "entry_price": 150.50,
  "exit_price": 155.00,
  "entry_currency": "USD",
  "start_date": "2024-10-15",
  "end_date": "2025-09-30",
  "prices": [
    {"date": "2024-10-15", "close": 145.20},
    ...
  ],
  "error": null
}
```
