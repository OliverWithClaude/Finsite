# Position Management Implementation - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully implemented trading position management for Finsite with buy/sell tracking and P&L calculations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend (Python/FastAPI/SQLite)

#### Database Schema
- **positions table**: Stores open and closed positions with entry/exit data
- **trades table**: Stores individual buy/sell trades linked to positions
- Both tables created with proper foreign keys and relationships

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/positions/open` - Create buy trade and open position
- `POST /api/positions/{id}/close` - Create sell trade and close position
- `GET /api/positions/open` - List open positions with current valuations
- `GET /api/positions/closed` - List closed positions with P&L
- `GET /api/positions/{id}` - Get single position details

#### New Services
- **position_service.py**: Business logic for position management
  - Creates positions with buy trades
  - Closes positions with sell trades
  - Calculates current values using yfinance
  - Calculates profit/loss and holding periods

### 2. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

#### New UI Components
- **Navigation bar**: Switch between Watchlist, Open Positions, and Closed Positions
- **Buy button**: Added to each ticker in watchlist
- **Buy Modal**: Form to open new positions with:
  - Entry date
  - Entry value (EUR)
  - Entry price per share
  - Currency (EUR/USD)
  
- **Open Positions Table**: Shows:
  - Ticker, entry date, entry value, entry price
  - Current price (live from yfinance)
  - Current value (calculated)
  - Unrealized P/L in EUR and %
  - Close button

- **Sell Modal**: Form to close positions with:
  - Pre-filled reference data (entry date, value, price)
  - Exit date
  - Exit value (EUR)
  - Exit price per share
  - Currency (EUR/USD)

- **Closed Positions Table**: Shows:
  - Ticker, entry/exit dates and values
  - Realized profit/loss in EUR and %
  - Holding period in days

### 3. Styling
- Consistent with existing Finsite design
- Professional tables with hover effects
- Color-coded profit/loss (teal for positive, crimson for negative)
- Modal dialogs with proper styling
- Responsive design maintained
